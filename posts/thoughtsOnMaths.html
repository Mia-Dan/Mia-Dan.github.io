    <p>Some said, "Math feels like reality."</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I have sympathy with that: the discourses of maths are "concrete". As long as its terms, equations, etc, are used properly, any two trained people would be able to *comprehend the same thing*.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is so special. In daily life and in stories we hear or read, too often there are emotional facts and untold assuptions standing between that it seems no two person would have exact the same understanding of the very same thing. We thus struggle with the trouble to fully understand each other in reality. But when deal with maths, we are guaranteed that, or at least we have the faith that, with enough effort on communication we would reach the exact thing in different mind.</p>
